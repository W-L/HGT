# HGT

Interactive report of the internship project on horizontal gene transfer between Legionella pneumophila corby and Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus. Implemented as shiny app 

NOTE TO SELF (12/05/2020):
shiny app does not work properly anymore because `data.table` changed some defaults of the `fread()` function (and I was too lazy to explicitly specify all arguments)
