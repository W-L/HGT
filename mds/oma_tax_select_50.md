The plot on the left shows the distances of all orthologs of the selected species from the drop-down menu. These distances are ordered according to the position of the legionella orthologs along its genome, to potentially visualize clusters of HGT. The distribution of distances is shown as a histogram on the right, the red line indicates the mean in both plots. 

The left plot is zoomable. Binsize on the right plot can be modified, e. g. if there are just a few orthologs.
